## Computed parameters:

Below is the full list of parameters computed and exported with the `sounding_compute()` function:

**Parcel parameters:**

All CAPE parameters are calculated by integrating parcel positive buoyancy between level of free convection (LFC) and equilibrium level (EL). All CIN parameters are calculated by integrating parcel negative buoyancy between parcel initialization height and level of free convection (LFC). Most-unstable (MU) parcel is defined based on the highest theta-e between surface and 3 km above ground level (AGL). Mixed-layer (ML) parcel is calculated by averaging theta and mixing ratio over 0–500 m AGL layer and initializing from surface.

## Accuracy tables for `sounding_compute()` 

The interpolation algorithm used in the `sounding_compute()` function impacts accuracy of parameters such as CAPE or CIN and the performance of the script. The valid options for the `accuracy` parameter are 1, 2 or 3:

`accuracy = 1` - High performance but low accuracy. Dedicated for large dataset when output data needs to be quickly available (e.g. operational numerical weather models). This option is around 20 times faster than high accuracy (3) setting. Interpolation is peformed for 60 levels (m AGL): 

```{r accuracy1, echo = FALSE}
c(0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800, 3000, 3200, 3400, 3600, 3800, 4000, 4200, 4400, 4600, 4800, 5000, 5200, 5400, 5600, 5800, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, 10500, 11000, 11500, 12000, 12500, 13000, 13500, 14000, 15000, 16000, 17000, 18000, 19000, 20000)
```

`accuracy = 2` - Compromise between script performance and accuracy. Recommended for efficient processing of large numerical weather prediction datasets such as meteorological reanalyses for research studies. This option is around 10 times faster than high accuracy (3) setting. Interpolation is peformed for 318 levels (m AGL): 

```{r accuracy2, echo = FALSE}

`accuracy = 3`: High accuracy but low performance setting. Recommended for analysing individual profiles. Interpolation is performed with 5 m vertical resolution step up to 20 km AGL (i.e.: `0, 5, 10, ... 20000` m AGL)

## Performance comparison:

```{r performance, echo=TRUE}
library(thunder)
data("sounding_vienna")
t1 = system.time(sounding_compute(sounding_vienna$pressure, sounding_vienna$altitude, sounding_vienna$temp, sounding_vienna$dpt, sounding_vienna$wd, sounding_vienna$ws, accuracy = 1))
t2 = system.time(sounding_compute(sounding_vienna$pressure, sounding_vienna$altitude, sounding_vienna$temp, sounding_vienna$dpt, sounding_vienna$wd, sounding_vienna$ws, accuracy = 2))
t3 = system.time(sounding_compute(sounding_vienna$pressure, sounding_vienna$altitude, sounding_vienna$temp, sounding_vienna$dpt, sounding_vienna$wd, sounding_vienna$ws, accuracy = 3))
