**`thundeR`** is a freeware R package and collection of functions for rapid computation and visualisation of convective parameters commonly used in the operational forecasting of severe convective storms. Core algorithm is based on C++ code implemented into R language via `Rcpp`. This solution allows to compute over 200 thermodynamic and kinematic parameters in less than 0.02s per profile and process large datasets such as reanalyses or operational NWP models in a reasonable amount of time. Package has been developed since 2017 by research meteorologists specializing in severe convective storms and is constantly updated with new features.

## Online browser:

Online rawinsonde browser of `thundeR` package is available at <http://rawinsonde.com>

## Main functions:

- **`sounding_compute()`** - A core function for calculating convective parameters commonly used in the operational prediction of severe convective storms. Returns a vector of parameters.
 
- **`sounding_plot()`** - Function to plot a composite of Skew-T, hodograph and selected convective parameters on a single layout

- **`sounding_save()`**` - Auxiliary function to `sounding_plot` that plots a composite of Skew-T, hodograph and selected convective parameters on a single layout and exports graphical file.

- **`get_sounding()`** - Download rawinsonde measurement from sounding database of the University of Wyoming in a form convenient to use with `thundeR` package.

### 2. Accuracy tables for `sounding_compute()` 

The interpolation algorithm used in the `sounding_compute()` function impacts accuracy of parameters such as CAPE or CIN and the performance of the script. The valid options for the `accuracy` parameter are 1, 2 or 3:

`accuracy = 1` - High performance but low accuracy. Dedicated for large dataset when output data needs to be quickly available (e.g. operational numerical weather models). This option is around 20 times faster than high accuracy (3) setting. Interpolation is peformed for 60 levels (m AGL): 

```{r accuracy1, echo = FALSE}
c(0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800, 3000, 3200, 3400, 3600, 3800, 4000, 4200, 4400, 4600, 4800, 5000, 5200, 5400, 5600, 5800, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, 10500, 11000, 11500, 12000, 12500, 13000, 13500, 14000, 15000, 16000, 17000, 18000, 19000, 20000)
```

`accuracy = 2` - Compromise between script performance and accuracy. Recommended for efficient processing of large numerical weather prediction datasets such as meteorological reanalyses for research studies. This option is around 10 times faster than high accuracy (3) setting. Interpolation is peformed for 318 levels (m AGL): 

```{r accuracy2, echo = FALSE}

### Performance comparison:

```{r performance, echo=TRUE}
library(thunder)
data("sounding_vienna")
t1 = system.time(sounding_compute(sounding_vienna$pressure, sounding_vienna$altitude, sounding_vienna$temp, sounding_vienna$dpt, sounding_vienna$wd, sounding_vienna$ws, accuracy = 1))
t2 = system.time(sounding_compute(sounding_vienna$pressure, sounding_vienna$altitude, sounding_vienna$temp, sounding_vienna$dpt, sounding_vienna$wd, sounding_vienna$ws, accuracy = 2))
t3 = system.time(sounding_compute(sounding_vienna$pressure, sounding_vienna$altitude, sounding_vienna$temp, sounding_vienna$dpt, sounding_vienna$wd, sounding_vienna$ws, accuracy = 3))
print(t1)
print(t2)
print(t3)
```

### Important notes

- Remember to always input wind speed data in knots. 
- Script will always consider first height level as the surface (h = 0), therefore input height data can be as above sea level (ASL) or above ground level (AGL). 
- For efficiency purposes it is highly recommended to input data for a maximum of 16-18 km AGL or lower.
- Values of parameters will be different for different accuracy settings.
